# Developing
Jordan's template for is available at [this github repo](https://github.com/jordanbw1/itc350-template/blob/main/main.py) and may be helpful as a reference as we figure out the templating and stuff for ourselves. You may also want to look at the [flask quick start](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/quickstart). Finally it is recommended that you run `python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex())'` for generating the secret in the .env file
